# Hi there 👋 I'm **Lisa**.

I am a Data Scientist living in Bavaria and specializing in medical imaging, deep learning, and clinical AI.
I work across the full stack of AI for healthcare — from model development and evaluation to data governance, annotation pipelines, and SaMD documentation..

## 🧠 About Me

- 👁️ I’m currently working on application AI to help in retinal disease treatment.
- 🤓 I hold a doctoral degree in [ML / DL in clinical neuroimaging](https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/quantitative-neuroimaging-with-handcrafted-and-deep-radiomics-in-/).
- 🌱 My skillset is data- and modelling-heavy (I can suggest from scratch a dosen of statistical, mechanical, and even electric heart models), and now I’m focused on system building skills development.
- 🗣️ Languages: *English, Russian, French, and German is work in progress...*
